Testing Basically
| Member | Primary Responsibility | Files / Parts to Work On | Tasks in Detail |
|:-------|:------------------------|:--------------------------|:----------------|
| 🟦 **Member A – Board & Setup Engineer** | Responsible for the board display and piece setup | `board.py` | - Design the 8×8 board (list of lists or class structure). <br> - Initialize Red and Black pieces in correct positions. <br> - Display board clearly (text-based grid or GUI using Pygame). <br> - Optional: simple function to print or render the board after every move. <br> - Coordinate with Member D to ensure visuals align with menu and game interface. |
| 🟩 **Member B – Game Logic & Rules Developer** | Handles movement, capturing, and king promotion logic | `game_logic.py` | - Implement move validation (forward diagonal for men, both for kings). <br> - Implement capture logic (mandatory capture, multiple jumps). <br> - Add king promotion rules and highlight promoted pieces. <br> - Handle turn switching and move legality checks. <br> - Communicate with Member D to integrate gameplay loop and event handling. |
| 🟨 **Member C – File System & Persistence Lead** | Implements saving/loading, score tracking, and win detection | `file_manager.py`, `checkers_save.txt` | - Implement save/load of game state (e.g., to `checkers_save.txt`). <br> - Handle file structure (JSON or text format). <br> - Write helper functions: `save_board()`, `load_board()`, `save_score()`, etc. <br> - Implement game-end detection (no moves left / all opponent pieces captured). <br> - Ensure compatibility with main integration for smooth restarts and menu returns. |
| 🟥 **Member D – Main Integration, Menu & Documentation Lead** | Responsible for game flow, menu system, sound integration, and documentation | `main.py`, `menu.py`, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `assets/sounds/`, `assets/images/` | - Integrate all modules (`board.py`, `game_logic.py`, `file_manager.py`) into one complete system. <br> - **Implement Menu System** (`menu.py`): build start screen with *Play*, *Quit*, and optional *Credits* buttons. <br> - Manage transitions between Menu → Game → Back to Menu. <br> - Add visual background (images, logos) from `assets/images/`. <br> - **Add Sound Effects**: integrate `pygame.mixer` for click, move, and capture sounds. <br> - Add looping background music on the menu and adjust sound balance. <br> - Handle user input events (piece selection, restart, quit). <br> - Write and maintain documentation (`README.md`): overview, how to play, how to run, team roles. <br> - Update `requirements.txt` with dependencies (e.g., Pygame). <br> - Perform final integration and full game testing. <br> - Optional: add hover effects and fade-in/out for music transitions. |
